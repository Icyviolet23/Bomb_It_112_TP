# Bomb_It_112_TP
CMU 112 Term Project


# A short description of the project's name and what it does. 

Bomb it 112 will be a 16x16 grid-based game where players will place bombs that explode in a fixed cross. 

Bomb explosions destroy terrain and can kill other players if other players are caught up in the explosion radius. 

Destroyed terrain reveals powerups which can provide powerful abilities.

Players will start off with 10 lives and the goal is to deplete the lives of the opponents. 

Moving over lava traps will decrease player life by 1.

Collecting randomly generated hearts will increase player life by one.

Use "WASD" to move. Use "Enter" to place a bomb. More instructions provided in the game.
